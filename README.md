# Hack The Box Writeups — by Erviano Florentino Susanto

This repository showcases my practical penetration-testing experience through sanitized writeups from Hack The Box machines.  
Each writeup demonstrates a full exploitation path — from enumeration to privilege escalation — with redacted sensitive data for ethical sharing.

## 📂 Included Machines

| Box | OS | Difficulty | Focus Areas |
|-----|----|-------------|--------------|
| [Dark Zero](./DarkZero) | Windows | Hard | Active Directory • SQL Server • Kerberos • Lateral Movement |
| [Expressway](./Expressway) | Linux | Easy | IPsec VPN • UDP Enumeration • Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-32463) |
| [Soulmate](./Soulmate) | Linux | Easy | CrushFTP Auth Bypass (CVE-2025-31161) • Web Shell • Erlang SSH (root) |
| [Conversor](./Conversor) | Linux | Easy | XSLT Injection • Cron RCE • Weak Hash Cracking • needrestart Sudo |

Each folder contains a detailed **README.md** explaining methodology, key takeaways, and defensive recommendations.  
Sensitive data such as IPs, credentials, and flags are replaced with placeholders.
